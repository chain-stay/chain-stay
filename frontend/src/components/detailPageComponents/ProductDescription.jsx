        an extremely evocative unconventional stay. 3 min. from the bus/taxi

        meters away. Online staff always available. The space A room furnished
        with evocative local architecture, and antique frescoes on the ceiling.

        Small bathroom with shower and shower vase / bidet. Balcony sea view
        adjacent to the room with chairs and coffee table. Large private patio

        <BoldText>Guest access</BoldText>
        <br />
        The room is independent. The entrance door is exclusive to guests and is
        equipped with a small private balcony overlooking the sea and with a
        large patio that is reserved for guests (excluding the use of patio
        spaces that are reserved for staff, which are signposted)

      <Paragraph>
        <BoldText>Other things to note</BoldText>
        <br />* Wi-Fi is fast but being on an island and by the sea, sometimes
        the signal may be weak or missing. Close to the bed, the signal is
        stronger. ** Breakfast is not included but can be booked the day before.
        *** The cleaning and linen change service takes place once a day.
        check-in but you can request, with an additional cost, also an extra and
        daily cleaning. *** Check-in is self-contained and there is no staff at
        check-in. For this reason we will ask online for the photo of the
        documents of all guests, in order to register them and comply with local
        laws, avoiding fines.

        <BoldText>Please note:</BoldText>
        <br />
        the SMALL kitchen, as shown in the photos, is not suitable for cooking
        but it is only a small point where you can prepare a coffee and rinse a
        cup. The stove is transportable just to allow you to move it outside as
        there is no space for large operations. It is like that for small boats.
        Capri is an island made of stairs. Wherever you'll find them!
